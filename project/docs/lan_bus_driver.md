# LAN Bus driver

## General information

Stefani Coco
Dmytro Iazykov

*LAN Bus driver*: Develop a driver PCB, that makes the existing parallel bus system available via ethernet.

## Project sketch

- The institute of experimental physics has developed several devices that are controlled via a custom bus system. The bus is mostly controlled by an expensive extension card from a computer.
- This project aims to add real-time control of these devices via ethernet using an STM32 microcontroller.
- The designed devices should also provide the power supply for the controlled devices and, if required, a logic level conversion. Ideally via power over ethernet.
- The aim is to design and assemble a prototype PCB.
- The block diagram will be created during the project.
- The requirements, such as bandwidth, signal levels, and digital complexity, will be determined by the students.

State how your project will address the following requirements:

### Mandatory requirements
- The project will focus on developing a PCB prototype.
- A first prototype can be made without fabricating a PCB, using the STM32 development board, and a custom soldered board.

### Negotiable requirements
- The project is directly integrated in current experimental control systems
- The project includes power supply design (analog) and microprocessor programming. 
- The project will use an STM32

## Project goals

The goals will be formulated during the project.

1. *minimal goal* that should be achievable even in the worst case. E.g. Demonstrate prototype analog circuit on a breadboard.
2. A *realistic goal* that you are confindent that you will achieve. E.g. Demonstrate entire prototype, including analog and digital parts. 
3. An *ideal goal* that you think you can achieve if everything goes to plan. E.g. Design, assemble, and test prototype PCBs

## Work plan and time schedule

- Name the intermediate steps you need to perform in order to realize the prototype
- Estimate the required time for each step.
- Include the expected time for your three goals
